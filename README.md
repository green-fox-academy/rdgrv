Hey there! This is my Green Fox Academy repository, in which you can find my solutions to the exercises.<br/>
My separate projects from week 5 and week 8 (both reuploaded, the latter continued ever since) can be found here:<br/>

[My 90s disco-type Wanderer game](https://github.com/rdgrv/wanderer)<br/>
-> an rpg-style game with an interesting (and colorful) twist

[My toCookApp](https://github.com/rdgrv/tocook) - my most recent pet project<br/>
-> an online cookbook application for storing and managing recipes

Thank you for checking my work out, have a nice day!
